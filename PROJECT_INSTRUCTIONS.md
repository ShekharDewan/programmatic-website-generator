# PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.MD - Programmatic Content Generation System

## 1. Project Objective

This project aims to establish a robust, **code-centric system for the automated generation, management, and publishing of structured web content.** The core purpose is to enable the creation of numerous content pages—such as articles, listings, product details, documentation, or programmatic SEO pages—directly from code, data sources, and predefined templates.

This approach bypasses traditional manual content entry through a GUI-based Content Management System (CMS). It prioritizes:

* **Developer Control:** Full governance over content structure, generation logic, and presentation.
* **Content as Code:** Content (or its source data) is versioned within a Git repository alongside application code, enabling better tracking, rollbacks, and collaborative workflows.
* **Scalability:** Designed to efficiently handle high-volume publishing (e.g., tens to hundreds of new pages daily or in batches).
* **Automation:** Streamlined processes for content creation, updates, and internal linking.
* **Flexibility:** Adaptable to various content types and dynamic data integration.

Essentially, this system is for scenarios where content creation is driven by programmatic logic, data transformations, or the need for large-scale, consistent page generation that would be cumbersome or inefficient with a manual CMS.

## 2. Chosen Technology Stack

* **Framework:** **Next.js 14+ (with App Router)**
    * *Why:* Excellent for building performant, SEO-friendly static and server-rendered applications. The App Router provides a modern and robust routing and layout system. Supports MDX out-of-the-box or with minimal configuration.
* **Content Format:** **MDX (Markdown + JSX)**
    * *Why:* Allows writing content in familiar Markdown syntax while also enabling the embedding of custom React components directly within the content for richer, more interactive posts.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**
    * *Why:* A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development, highly configurable, and integrates well with Next.js.
* **Automation & Scripting:** **Node.js**
    * *Why:* JavaScript runtime environment that allows using the same language for both frontend and backend/scripting tasks. `fs-extra` for file system operations and `slugify` for creating URL-friendly slugs.
* **Deployment:** **Vercel (Recommended)** or Netlify, AWS Amplify, Cloudflare Pages.
    * *Why Vercel:* Built by the creators of Next.js, offering seamless integration, CI/CD, global CDN, and optimized performance for Next.js projects.
* **Version Control:** **Git**
    * *Why:* Standard for version control, enabling tracking changes, collaboration, and rollbacks.

### Purpose of Key Files and Directories:

* **`app/`**: Core directory for Next.js App Router.
    * **`app/layout.tsx`**: Defines the root HTML structure (e.g., `<html>`, `<body>` tags) and wraps all pages. Good for global navigation, footers, and context providers.
    * **`app/globals.css`**: Contains global styles and Tailwind CSS `@tailwind` directives.
    * **`app/blog/page.tsx`**: (Example for a 'blog' content type) The main listing page for this content type. It will fetch metadata for all relevant content items from `content/blog/`, sort them, and render a list (likely using a `ContentCard` component) with links to individual pages. This pattern can be replicated for other content types (e.g., `app/products/page.tsx`).
    * **`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`**: (Example for a 'blog' content type) The template for individual content pages. `[slug]` corresponds to the filename of an MDX file in `content/blog/`. This component fetches the specific MDX file, parses its frontmatter and content, and renders it. It also handles generating metadata for SEO.
* **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components.
    * `ContentCard.tsx`: An example component for displaying a preview of a content item.
    * `Navbar.tsx`: An example site navigation bar.
* **`content/`**: This is the **content repository**. All generated content, typically as `.mdx` files, is stored here, organized into subdirectories by content type (e.g., `content/blog/`, `content/products/`).
    * `content/blog/example-post.mdx`: An example MDX file. Its frontmatter contains metadata (title, date, tags, etc.).
* **`public/`**: For static assets like images or fonts.
* **`scripts/`**: Contains Node.js scripts for automating content management.
    * **`scripts/generate-content.js`**:
        * **Purpose:** To create a single new `.mdx` content file with pre-filled frontmatter, adaptable for different content types.
        * **Functionality:** Takes inputs (e.g., title, target content type directory, specific metadata fields). Generates a URL-friendly slug. Creates a new `.mdx` file in the appropriate subdirectory within `content/` (e.g., `content/blog/`). Populates the file with YAML frontmatter and placeholder body content.
    * **`scripts/bulk-generate.js`**:
        * **Purpose:** To create multiple content files programmatically.
        * **Functionality:** Uses `generate-content.js` or similar logic in a loop. Can be driven by arrays of data, external APIs, or predefined generation rules for different content types.
* **`next.config.js`**: Configures Next.js, including MDX support setup.
* **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and defines `scripts` for common tasks (dev, build, lint, content generation scripts).
* **`tailwind.config.js`** and **`postcss.config.js`**: Configuration files for Tailwind CSS.

## 4. Workflow for Content Generation and Management

1.  **Setup:**
    * Clone repository, run `npm install`.

2.  **Generating Content (Single or Bulk):**
    * Use `npm run generate -- --title "..." --type "blog" ...` for single items.
    * Use `npm run bulk-generate -- --count 20 --type "product" ...` for bulk operations.
    * Scripts should place generated `.mdx` files into the correct subdirectory within `content/` (e.g., `content/blog/`, `content/products/`).

3.  **Content Structure (Inside `.mdx` files):**
    ```mdx
    ---
    title: "Example Content Title"
    slug: "example-content-slug"
    date: "2025-05-26"
    # ... other common or type-specific metadata ...
    tags: ["tagA", "tagB"]
    related_items: ["other-slug-1", "other-slug-2"]
    ---

    # Main Content Body

    Supports Markdown and <CustomReactComponents />.
    ```

4.  **Development & Preview:**
    * Run `npm run dev`. View at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Building & Deployment:**
    * `npm run build`.
    * Commit changes (including new files in `content/`) to Git.
    * Deploy via Vercel, Netlify, etc., typically configured for auto-deployment on Git pushes.

## 5. Verification Points for Developer/AI Review

1.  **MDX Configuration (`next.config.js`):** Correctly set up for processing `.mdx` files.
2.  **Dynamic Content Pages (e.g., `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`):**
    * Correctly uses `generateStaticParams` (App Router) for SSG.
    * Fetches, parses frontmatter and MDX content for the given slug.
    * Renders MDX content and SEO metadata.
    * Handles 404s for non-existent slugs.
3.  **Index/Listing Pages (e.g., `app/blog/page.tsx`):**
    * Reads all relevant `.mdx` files for its content type.
    * Parses frontmatter for display (titles, excerpts, etc.).
    * Links correctly to individual content pages.
    * Supports sorting/filtering if applicable.
4.  **Content Generation Scripts (`scripts/`):**
    * `generate-content.js`: Creates single `.mdx` files in the correct `content/` subdirectory with accurate frontmatter and slug.
    * `bulk-generate.js`: Generates multiple unique posts, adaptable for varied content.
5.  **Internal Linking:** Mechanism (e.g., `related_items` in frontmatter) defined and rendered in templates.
6.  **Styling, Layout, Build, Deployment:** Standard checks for correctness and functionality.

This detailed instruction set should provide a clear understanding of the project's architecture, goals, and operational workflow, enabling effective review and development.
